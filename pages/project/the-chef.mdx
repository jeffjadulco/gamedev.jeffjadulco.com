The Chef is a time management game where you, as a chef, have to serve meals to customers while keeping your tummy happy. Avoid getting caught by customers, so be careful about when eating someone else's meal!

This game was made for an internal game jam with the theme: **Against the Rules**.

## Responsibilities

- Programmed the whole game
- Sound integration
- Designed the game with the team

## What's cool about it?

- Utilized Phaser's Time API for time-driven behaviors of customers and cooking states.
- Amazing pixel art by [James Pajunar](https://www.instagram.com/kojiro_ai/) and [Arvin Pantollano](https://www.instagram.com/artofarvinp/)
- Endless levels!
