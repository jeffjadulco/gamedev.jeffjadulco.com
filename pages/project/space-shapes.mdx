Space Shapes is a Space Impact clone with a shoot 'em up gameplay. Battle enemy shapes using fast bullets and an arsenal of power ups!

This game has a special place in my heart because this was the start of my gamedev career. I made this for my application exam for **[Secret 6](https://secret6.com/)** (which is where I'm at now).

In less than a week, I learned more about developing a 2D game in Unity and making art assets such as sprite sheets. This was also my first time learning about _game feel_ and used **[these](https://youtu.be/Fy0aCDmgnxg) [techniques](https://youtu.be/AJdEqssNZ-U)** to make the game juicy.

## Responsibilities

- Programmed the whole game
- Utilized 2D physics for interesting power up mechanics
- Created all art assets
