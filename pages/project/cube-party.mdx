Cube Party is an offline 4-player battle arena where music influences the level. Players must avoid lasers spawned by the game and gain the highest score.

This game was made for an internal game jam with the theme: **Party**.

The level was inpired by a typical club scene where a DJ is playing music at the front while people dance on the dance floor.
